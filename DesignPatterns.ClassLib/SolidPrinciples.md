# **SOLID Principles**

**SOLID** is a set of five principles intended to make software designs more flexible and maintainable. It helps building softwares with more coesive code and less coupling. Each letter of the acronym corresponds to a principle.

# **S**  
**Single Responsibility Principle**  
A class should have only a single responsibility, only one reason to change  
(high-cohesion, low-coupling)

# **O**  
**Open/Closed Principle**  
Entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

# **L**  
**Liskov Substitution Principle**  
Objects should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of the program, otherwise you may be using the wrong abstraction.

# **I**  
**Interface Segragation Principle**  
Avoid one general purpose interface by creating more specific interfaces

# **D**  
**Dependency Inversion Principle**  
Depend upon abstractions, not concretions. (reduce coupling)
